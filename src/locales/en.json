  "UsageTipsSecuringFoldersHeading": "Securing entire folders",
  "UsageTipsSecuringFoldersText1": "AxCrypt secures files, individually. However, you can designate folders as ‘secured’. The folders will be monitored for new files, and AxCrypt will secure all new files with a single click, or when you sign out.",
  "UsageTipsSecuringFoldersText2": "You can also select multiple files, including all files in a folder, to be secured in a single operation. They still remain individual files, and the folder itself is not secured, just the files in it.",
  "UsageTipsBackupsHeading": "Backups",
  "UsageTipsBackupsText1": "Do you do your backups to CD’s or DVD’s, the cloud, or just to files on another hard-disk using backup programs or perhaps WinZip? If you secure the backup-archive with AxCrypt, you can then store the backup or file in any place, without fear of your privacy being violated should it get lost.",
  "UsageTipsBackupsText2": "Store a copy of the standalone version of AxCrypt with your backup, and you are independent of an AxCrypt installation when you need to recover.",
  "UsageTipsConfidentialDataHeading": "Condifential data in cloud storage services",
  "UsageTipsConfidentialDataText1": "Secure your documents with AxCrypt and be assured of preserved confidentiality from your PC to the cloud service and back to your PC.",
  "UsageTipsConfidentialDataText2": "There are many web-services that allow you to upload documents, such as project services and similar. If you feel uncomfortable uploading sensitive information there, regardless of the providers assurances, secure the documents.",
  "UsageTipsNetworksHeading": "Networks",
  "UsageTipsNetworksText1": "When you secure your data with AxCrypt, it’s never seen on the network, the server or backups in the clear.",
  "UsageTipsNetworksText2": "When you store a document on a Local Area Network-server, the data is usually stored in clear-text there, even when access controls are in place, accessible to all system-administrators as well as others who by chance or mistake happen to get read-access.",
  "UsageTipsNetworksText3": "The data also travels the network in the clear, easily sniffable by anyone on the same network segment. Backups are also seldom secured, so anyone gaining access to a backup-tape has potential access, regardless of the access controls enforced on the server.",
  "UsageTipsNetworksText4": "All of these cases are handled when the data is secured with AxCrypt.",
  "UsageTipsPreDistributionHeading": "Pre-distribution",
  "UsageTipsPreDistributionText1": "Some information should be confidential up to a certain time, and then it’s not. It might be a movie trailer, a quarterly financial report or something similar. Secure your file – document, movie trailer or report, distribute it by any means and be assured that it’s unreadable until  a time when you choose to release the information.",
  "UsageTipsPreDistributionText2": "Information that must be prepared ahead of time, and is beneficial to have the distribution done beforehand – even though it must not be disclosed until a certain time. Use AxCrypt to secure the document, for example the PDF of the financial report. You can then distribute it by any means, hours and days ahead of time, the information is out there but unreadable. When it’s time to disclose, simply publish the password used. This reduces peak server loads and eases distribution.",
  "UsageTipsConfidentialEmailHeading": "Confidential e-mail",
  "UsageTipsConfidentialEmailText1": "A quick and easy method to communicate between two parties. Use AxCrypt to send private e-mail messages.",
  "UsageTipsConfidentialEmailText2": "Write the initial message using Notepad, WordPad or Microsoft Word. Secure the result, add the recipient to the team member list and send it to the other party.",
  "UsageTipsConfidentialEmailText3": "The other party will now be able to open and edit the message directly, respond etc, and then reply and attach the automatically updated secure file in a quick and convenient manner.",
  "UsageTipsConfidentialEmailText4": "This is not quite as easy as regular mail – but not far from it – and most approaches instead require encrypting and decrypting using the clipboard with cut and paste.",
  "UsageTipsHideShowHeading": "Hide/show the .axx extention",
  "UsageTipsHideShowText1": "Normally, AxCrypt files will display the .axx extension or not, depending on your global Windows settings. This behavior may be changed by modifying the Windows registry.",
  "UsageTipsHideShowText2": "AxCrypt does not implement any configuration settings to keep things simple, but if you really want this, you can modify the registry manually. If you do not know how to do this, you should probably refrain as the full implications may not be clear then.",
  "SecurityDescriptionText": "In order to achieve good security, it’s beneficial to understand a little bit about how to best use AxCrypt with passwords and local PC security. There are also some details on the algorithms and methods used in AxCrypt below.",
  "SecurityBlock1Heading": "Why is AxCrypt secure?",
  "SecurityBlock1Text": "AxCrypt is secure because it endeavors to only use accepted practices and algorithms and does not attempt to invent any new encryption algorithms or methods.  It’s also open source; Anyone may inspect the source code, check it for errors, omissions or back doors. It has been used and inspected for vulnerabilities for over 15 years and tried by more than 30 million users, without any known weaknesses.",
  "SecurityBlock2Heading": "How secure is AxCrypt?",
  "SecurityBlock2Text": "This question breaks down to effective encryption key lengths. The key length used is 128 or 256 bits – exhaustive search is not currently believed to be an option in either case and it is computationally infeasible in cryptographic terms. The problem lies with the passwords used – this is the weak point. You can read more about what to consider when choosing a password below.",
  "SecurityBlock3Heading": "Password considerations",
  "SecurityBlock3Text1": "AxCrypt uses AES-128 or AES-256 in the Premium version – but if you want to achieve that level of security you must give it 128 or 256 bits of truly ‘random’ data. This is very hard to do, but the easiest way to even approach this is to use the password generator included in Premium.",
  "SecurityBlock3Text2": "To actually get 128 or 256 bits, you’ll in practice have to save this password in a text file, and then keep that text file very secret.Using typical English language in a password, 128 bits is approximately equivalent to 10 ‘random’ words, and 256 bits thus twice this. Do not use meaningful sentences and absolutely not famous or even obscure quotations!By introducing variations on the case, as well as non-alphabetic characters you can reduce the number of words necessary. It’s not recommended to use less than 5 words. If you use a completely random selection of upper and lower-case letters and digits, you need 22 characters to achieve 128 bits security, and thus 44 characters for 256 bits. (The above is a slight simplification of the issue, but it should serve.)The shredding, or wiping, feature of AxCrypt allows you to erase files in a way that makes it impossible to recover the contents with undeletion software. However, there are some caveats:",
  "SecurityBlock3ListItem1": "The name of the file, as well as the size, may be recovered.",
  "SecurityBlock3ListItem2": "If the file has been viewed or edited with an application that creates temporary copies of the content (such as Microsoft Office), those temporary copies may still be available for undeletion on your hard disk.",
  "SecurityBlock3Text3": "See the section on local PC security for tips on how to increase your security margin for these matters.",
  "SecurityBlock4Heading": "Local PC Security",
  "SecurityBlock4Text1": "AxCrypt by itself will not protect your local PC from, for example:",
  "SecurityBlock4Text2": "Data exposure due to:",

  "SecurityBlock4List3Item2": "Password-protected screen savers.",
  "SecurityBlock5Heading": "Account Keys",
  "SecurityBlock5Text1": "An account key is what enables the implementation of various new rich features, such as allowing other team members to open secured files with their own passwords. In technical terms, an AxCrypt Account key consists of a public key pair composed of a public (non-secret) and a private (secret) part and some other meta data.",
  "SecurityBlock5Text2": "The account key is always kept secured with your password as well, although one part of it is not secret and is used when securing files for you and your team. For you, the benefit is that you can change the password for all files in one single operation. For your team members, the benefit is that you and your team can allow each other to open secured files without sharing passwords by just specifying the email address of the other member.",
  "SecurityBlock5Text3": "Anyone can use your email address to allow you to open a secured file with your own passphrase, and you can allow anyone with an email address to open a file secured by you. All this is enabled by the public part of the account key being available on our server.",
  "SecurityBlock6Heading": "Algorithms",
  "SecurityBlock6Text1": "The cryptological primitives are AES-128 or AES-256 for bulk encryption, PBKDF2 with HMAC-512 for key deriviation, 4096-bit RSA for the account key, and HMAC-512 for integrity checking.",
  "SecurityBlock6Text2": "The algorithms used are deemed secure as such, to the best of our knowledge, by the US Government and the Internet community. Please see the documents package and the source code for details.",
  "SecurityBlock6Text3": "Key wrapping of the password is done using the NIST specification for AES Key Wrap. The key derived from the password with PBKDF2-SHA512 is only used as a key encrypting key.",
  "SecurityBlock6Text4": "As a brute force counter measure, key wrapping is done with at least 5 000 iterations, increasing the work effort with approximately 12 bits. The actual iteration count is determined dynamically, a typical value is 25 000 to 100 000, adding 14-17 bits of effective key-length. The faster machine you install AxCrypt on – the better the security!",
  "SecurityBlock6Text5": "AxCrypt uses the Advanced Encryption Standard with 128-bit or 256-bit keys in Counter mode with a ‘random’ IV for the data encryption.",
  "SecurityBlock6Text6": "For integrity verification AxCrypt uses HMAC-SHA512, i.e. Hash Message Authentication Code using SHA-512 with 512-bit output.",
  "SecurityBlock6Text7": "The pseudo random number generator (PRNG) used is primarily the operating system provided one, in some cases with added entropy added.",
  "SecurityBlock6Text8": "There may well be bugs in our implementation though – that is why it’s open source, so you and our peers may review it and keep it safe. This should not be taken as a low level of confidence in our code – anyone who tells you their code is flawless is either inexperienced or lying.",
  "SecurityBlock7Heading": "Is AxCrypt HIPAA compliant?",
  "SecurityBlock7Text1": "There is no such thing as HIPAA compliant software. Only organizations and procedures can be HIPAA compliant.",
  "SecurityBlock7Text2": "The appropriate use of encryption and other Technical Safeguards is governed by the HIPAA Security Standards, 45 CFR 160, 162 and 164. The relevant section is 164.312 Technical Safeguards. No recommendations or requirements concerning specific encryption technologies are made there either, it’s specifically pointed out that the regulation is technology-neutral. It’s up to each and every organization to evaluate its position and risks, and then implement required or addressable specifications.",
  "SecurityBlock7Text3": "Although the standard in no way refers to it except in comments, the CMS Internet Security Policy, which is the current view of Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for their own use, does specify some minimal technology levels for certain cases. AxCrypt meets these requirements for transmission over the Internet – but your organization must independently evaluate if is sufficient to use the same level as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.",
  "SecurityBlock7Text4": "The parts where AxCrypt may (and should) suffice as (part of) a Technical Safeguard are:",
